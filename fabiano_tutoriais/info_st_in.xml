(1) Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. (You may need to do a small bit of research for this — give references!)
(2) What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?
(3) What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?
(4) What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?
